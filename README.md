# Workout / Study Timer (React Native Web) — Take‑Home Template

This repo is intentionally **almost** done. Your job is to complete a few TODOs (like a mini FreeCodeCamp-style challenge).

## What you’ll practice
- Following instructions
- Small, focused coding changes (JavaScript/TypeScript)
- A lightweight Git workflow: branch → commit → pull request

## Setup (StackBlitz / CodeSandbox)
1. Import this repo.
2. Run the dev server (usually auto-starts).
3. Open the app preview.

## Assignment
Complete the TODOs in:
- `src/timerLogic.ts`

When you’re done, the **Quick Checks** list in the UI should all show ✅.

### Required Git workflow
1. Create a new branch named `feature/<your-name>` (example: `feature/jordan`)
2. Commit your changes with a clear message.
3. Open a Pull Request (PR) back to `main`.
4. In the PR description, include:
   - What you changed
   - Anything that was tricky
   - A screenshot of the checks showing ✅

## Notes
- Keep your changes focused to `src/timerLogic.ts` unless you have a strong reason.
- You’re allowed to use the internet (docs, search, etc.). Show your process.
