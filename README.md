## What you’ll practice

- Following instructions
- Small, focused coding changes (JavaScript/TypeScript)
- A lightweight Git workflow: branch → commit → pull request

## Setup (CodeSandbox.io)

You may use a free online tool like [CodeSandbox.io](https://codeSandbox.io) to run the application.

1. Import this [repo](https://github.com/webmaster-lmc-solutions/workout-study-timer).
2. Run the dev server (usually auto-starts).
3. Open the app preview.

## Assignment

Complete the TODOs in:

- `src/timerLogic.ts`

When you’re done, the **Quick Checks** list in the UI should all show ✅.

### Required Git workflow

1. Create a new branch named `feature/<your-name>` (example: `feature/jordan`)
2. Commit your changes with a clear message.
3. Open a Pull Request (PR) back to `main`.
4. In the PR description, include:
   - What you changed
   - Anything that was tricky
   - A screenshot of the checks showing ✅

## Notes

- Keep your changes focused to `src/timerLogic.ts` unless you have a strong reason.
- You’re allowed to use the internet (docs, search, etc.). Show your process.
- Don't ask AI to complete the challenge for you.\*
